# ðŸ§® Discount Calculator in Python

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This simple Python script allows users to calculate the final price of an item after applying a discount.  
The discount is only applied if the percentage is **20% or higher** â€” otherwise, the original price is returned.

It's a great beginner-friendly example that demonstrates:

- Function definition and logic
- Conditional statements
- User input handling
- Error checking with `try-except`
